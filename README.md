Literature Review

<br />
Social data analysis is rapidly gaining popularity worldwide (Najork & Wiener, 2001; Leskovec & Faloutsos, 2006)  due to the emergence in the 1990s of online social networking services (SixDegrees, LiveJournal, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and others). Related to this is the phenomenon of the socialization of personal data: biographical facts, correspondence, diaries, photo, video, audio materials, travel notes, etc. became publicly available. Thus, social networks are a unique source of data about the personal lives and interests of real people. This opens unprecedented opportunities for solving research and business problems (many of which could not be solved efficiently before due to lack of data), as well as for creating support services and applications for social network users. In addition, this explains the increased interest in the collection and analysis of social data on the part of companies and research organizations.
<br />
According to Wasserman and Faust (Lazega et al., 1995), social networks can be constructed from relational data and can be defined as a set of social entities, such as people, groups, and organizations, with some relationships or interactions between them. These networks are usually modeled by graphs, where vertices represent the social entities and edges represent the ties established between them.
<br />
Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a core aspect of analyzing social networks today. It allows for studying multiple types of relations and how they operate (Borgatti et al., 2009; D端ring & Keyserlingk, 2015; Lemercier, 2015; Whetherell 1998). More specifically, network analysis encompasses a set of innovative theoretical, mathematical, statistical, and computational tools for analyzing, modeling and understanding networks. 
<br />
The main task of SNA is to study relations between social entities, be they individual actors, organizations, or groups of people (Wassermann & Faust, 1994). It can also be applied to study relations among non-human entities, such as publications, organizational affiliations, institutional structures, and many others. In either case, (social) network analysis allows to systematically analyze relational and attribute data in order to better understand latent structures and hidden patterns.These tasks are extremely useful in the process of extracting knowledge from networks and, consequently, in the process of problem-solving. Due to the appealing nature of such tasks and to the high potential opened by this kind of analyses, SNA has become a popular approach in a myriad of fields, from Biology to Business.
